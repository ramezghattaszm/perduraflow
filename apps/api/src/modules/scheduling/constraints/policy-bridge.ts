 * S1.3 — the mode → behavior bridge. Turns a per-constraint APPLICATION MODE (resolved from config,
 * `hard | soft | hard-with-slack`) into engine behavior:
 *   - **hard** → an S1.2 veto (enforced, not just reported) — routed to `preplaceVeto` / `feasibilityReject`.
 *   - **hard-with-slack** → a veto only past the resolved threshold.
 *   - **soft** → an objective factor (via the Option-B keyed registry) + an honest `ConstraintBinding`.
 *
 * **Inert in S1.3.** No constraint carries a mode: {@link CONSTRAINT_POLICIES} is empty AND
 * {@link MODE_GOVERNED_CONSTRAINTS} is empty (D28/D9/JIS are S2/S3). So every derivation below returns an
 * EMPTY set — no veto is registered, no factor is added, the honest binding stays `false` — and the plan +
 * objective + comparative surfaces are byte-identical. The synthetic-mode test exercises the live paths OFF
 * the demo, exactly as S1.2's synthetic-veto test does.
