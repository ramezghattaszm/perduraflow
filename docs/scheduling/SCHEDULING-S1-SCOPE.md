# Scheduling S1 scope — the constraint framework (the substrate)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Layer** | Scheduling production-completion · S1 — **the largest layer in the program**; the substrate S2/S3/S4 are all born on |
| **Written against** | Actual repo state (S1 ground-truth report) |
| **Governed by** | `SCHEDULING-PRODUCTION-COMPLETION-PLAN.md` §0; `PLATFORM-CONFIGURABLE-REFERENCE-SETS.md` (cascade, now reaching `line` via S0) |
| **Gate** | Propose-then-confirm; **byte-identical extraction** is the load-bearing discipline |
| **Locked** | (1) abstraction expresses **all five mechanisms**; (2) existing constraints **moved** into the registry (not two-homed); **EDD is a registered rank constraint**; **mechanism-by-mechanism** byte-identical extraction |

> **The finding that shaped S1:** the greedy loop has **no veto-and-reselect primitive** — every built constraint is a timing floor, a rank term, a candidacy gate, a feasibility-degrade, or a service pre-gate; *none* can say "this placement is illegal, pick another." That primitive is exactly what D28/D9/JIS need. So S1 is not "lift inline checks into a list" — it is **(a) a universal declarative constraint abstraction that describes every placement decision, (b) the missing veto primitive + cross-resource state, (c) hard/soft/slack as resolved config, (d) the resolved-set audit snapshot** — with the entire existing engine re-expressed through (a), proven byte-identical.

## 1. What ground truth settled (the design constraints)

- **Five injection mechanisms** (§2): `FLOOR` (into `Math.max` start), `RANK` (EDD-key bias), `CANDIDACY` (`isReady`/eligibility skip), `FEASIBILITY` (`placeJob → null` degrade), `PRE_GATE` (service-level, before the loop). The registry must reproduce all five — a flat boolean list would break byte-identicalness.
- **No veto-and-reselect** exists — the central new control-flow (S1.2).
- **The objective already speaks degree-of-violation:** every `scorePlan` factor's `rawValue` *is* a violation degree; `ConstraintBinding` already has `type:'hard'|'soft'` — but **hard is only *reported*, never *enforced*** (`binding:false` hardcoded). So soft-mode maps onto the objective cleanly; **hard-mode has no enforcement path in `scorePlan`** and must route to the veto primitive. The two design problems (veto + hard-mode) are one problem.
- **Two loci, different data shapes:** `sequence()` evaluates pre-placement `(item, resourceState, candidateStart)`; `scorePlan()` post-placement `(placement, plan)`. The declarative constraint must be a relation over a **schedule-model both can evaluate** — which is also the CP-SAT-adapter form (solver-neutrality, S4).
- **All state is `resourceId`-keyed** (§3); single-location needs `toolId`-keyed busy-intervals, tool-life a `toolId`-keyed usage ledger — new state axes, orthogonal-additive to `ResourceState`.
- **Extraction hazards (§7):** the ML `effectiveFor` overlay, the timing floors, min-batch quantity floor, operator scaling — **must reproduce exactly, including their ordering relative to candidacy.** This is the core byte-identical risk under decision (1).
- **Determinism (§4):** the tie-break/total-order + purity (no `Date.now()`/random). Re-expression must preserve it, and the **registry's evaluation order must be deterministic + declared** (an ordered mechanism-pipeline, not an unordered bag).

## 2. The universal constraint abstraction (the central artifact)

A **constraint** is a declarative object:
- **predicate/evaluation** — a relation over the **schedule-model** (op, resource, tool, window, sequence, candidate-start) producing a **degree of violation** (0 = satisfied, >0 = magnitude) and/or a **contribution** (a floor time, a rank delta) per its mechanism.
- **mechanism** — one of `FLOOR | RANK | CANDIDACY | FEASIBILITY | PRE_GATE` (extraction targets) — declares *how* the framework applies the evaluation.
- **expression vocabulary** — authored against an **explicit, versioned internal representation** (not ad-hoc TS predicates), so multi-solver adapters (S4) and eventual customer-authoring are exposures of this vocabulary, not rewrites.
- **application mode** (S1.3) — `hard | soft | hard-with-slack`, **resolved config**, deciding whether a violation vetoes, penalizes, or slacks-then-vetoes.
- **solver-neutral** — the constraint knows nothing of *when* (loop vs objective) or *by which engine* (greedy vs CP-SAT) it is evaluated; adapters compile it.

**The ordered mechanism-pipeline (mandatory under decision 1):** the registry evaluates constraints in a **declared phase order** reproducing today's inline sequence — `PRE_GATE → CANDIDACY → FLOOR → RANK → (place) → FEASIBILITY`. A floor must evaluate before candidacy, candidacy before ranking, etc., or byte-identicalness dies. The pipeline order is itself part of the determinism contract.

**EDD is a registered `RANK` constraint** — the base rank; changeover-bias and future rank constraints compose with it. So the engine's core ordering is data-described, and S4's CP-SAT expresses EDD as one model element rather than unwinding hardcoded logic.

**What stays inline (not extracted):** nothing legality/ordering-related — but the *arithmetic primitives* the constraints call (the ML `effectiveFor` duration overlay, operator scaling, the raw `Math.max`/`processMs` computation) remain functions the `FLOOR`/duration constraints *invoke*. The constraint declares "material floor applies here"; the millisecond math it calls is the same untouched function. This is the seam that makes byte-identical achievable: **move the *decision*, reuse the *arithmetic*.**

## 3. Sub-phases (ordering forced by the findings)

### S1.1 — universal abstraction + registry; extract all five mechanisms; **byte-identical, mechanism-by-mechanism**
The riskiest phase — it re-expresses the whole placement loop through the registry. De-risked by extracting **one mechanism at a time**, each proven byte-identical against the 1043-op lock + per-`Placement`-field equality + the four determinism invariants **before the next moves**:
1. Define the abstraction + ordered mechanism-pipeline + schedule-model; the registry runs the pipeline, initially wrapping the *existing* inline logic (no move yet) — prove identical.
2. Move **FLOOR** constraints (material, precedence, release, min-batch) — the hardest (timing arithmetic + ML-overlay interaction); reuse the arithmetic functions. Prove identical.
3. Move **CANDIDACY** (isReady, eligibility). Prove.
4. Move **RANK** (EDD base + changeover bias). Prove.
5. Move **FEASIBILITY** (placeJob-degrade). Prove.
6. Registry now owns the whole loop; inline mechanisms gone; **no new behavior, no veto yet.**
Determinism invariants preserved and asserted; ML overlay/quantity/operator arithmetic untouched (invoked, not moved).

### S1.2 — the veto-and-reselect primitive + cross-resource state
- Introduce the missing control-flow: a constraint (mechanism `FEASIBILITY` in *veto* form) can **reject a candidate placement → the loop reselects** (vs today's degrade). Deterministic reselection order.
- Introduce **`toolId`-keyed** state: a busy-interval structure (single-location) + a usage ledger (tool-life) — orthogonal-additive to `ResourceState`.
- **Inert on the demo:** no constraint *uses* veto or tool-state yet, so the schedule stays byte-identical. This isolates the scariest machinery from its first users (S2's D9/D28).

### S1.3 — hard/soft/slack as resolved config + the objective bridge
- Application mode resolves through the cascade **down to `line`** (the S0 rung): a constraint is hard/soft/slack per `global→tenant→plant→line`.
- **soft** → violation degree becomes a new `scorePlan` factor + `ConstraintBinding` (the objective already speaks this).
- **hard** → violation routes to the **veto primitive** (S1.2).
- **hard-with-slack** → veto only past the resolved threshold.
- Requires extending the closed `RationaleFactorKey`/`ObjectiveWeights` union through the cascade (or a keyed structure) — a real change to the objective's closed shape, scoped here.

### S1.4 — the D6 audit snapshot (determinism⇄audit convergence)
- The **resolved constraint set** (which constraints, which modes, which params/thresholds, resolved per scope) is snapshotted onto the committed `schedule_version` — this *is* D6's `constraint_set_ref`.
- Because mode+enablement are resolved config, the resolved set is **part of the determinism key** — a replay must resolve the same set. Capture makes a configured schedule reproducible; without it, reconstruction breaks.
- Folds the D6 half of the capture work (plan §Capture); §4.11 disposition-record stays independent/early.

## 4. Decisions to confirm

| ID | Decision | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| **D-S1-1** | Abstraction scope | **All five mechanisms** (locked) — the universal placement vocabulary; every decision data-described. |
| **D-S1-2** | Extract vs preserve | **Move** existing constraints into the registry (locked) — byte-identical extraction is the proof; no two-homed constraints. |
| **D-S1-3** | EDD | **Registered `RANK` constraint** (locked) — core ordering data-described; clean S4 swap. |
| **D-S1-4** | Extraction granularity | **Mechanism-by-mechanism**, each byte-identical before the next — a break localizes to the mechanism just moved (vs an unrebuggable whole-loop diff). |
| **D-S1-5** | Arithmetic seam | **Move the decision, reuse the arithmetic** — floors/ML-overlay/operator math stay as invoked functions; only *which constraint applies* moves. The seam that makes byte-identical feasible. |
| **D-S1-6** | Objective closed-shape | Extend `RationaleFactorKey`/`ObjectiveWeights` to a **keyed/registry-driven** structure so soft constraints add factors through config — confirm over keeping the closed 6-key union (which can't grow with registered constraints). |
| **D-S1-7** | Veto reselection order | Deterministic + declared (next-best candidate by the same total-order) — preserves the determinism contract through reselection. |

## 5. Definition of done

**S1.1:** whole placement loop runs through the registry; all five mechanisms extracted; EDD a registered rank constraint; **byte-identical** (1043 ops, per-`Placement`-field equality, 4 determinism invariants) proven **at each mechanism step**; ML/quantity/operator arithmetic untouched; no new behavior.
**S1.2:** veto-and-reselect primitive + `toolId`-keyed state exist; **inert** (demo byte-identical — nothing uses them).
**S1.3:** hard/soft/slack resolves through the cascade to `line`; soft→objective factor, hard→veto, slack→threshold-veto; objective closed-shape opened to registered constraints; **still byte-identical with default config** (no constraint enabled changes the demo).
**S1.4:** resolved constraint set snapshotted onto the committed version; part of the determinism key; a replay resolves the same set.
**All:** determinism contract preserved; `demo:reset` green; **demo schedule identical** through the entire layer (S1 changes *architecture*, not *behavior* — new behavior is S2+).

---

## 6. Scope boundary

**Out:** any *new* constraint (D28/D9/D8 → S2; D11/JIS → S3); the CP-SAT engine (S4 — but the abstraction is built solver-neutral for it); §4.11 disposition (independent/early); customer-authored constraint *types* (behavioral — the vocabulary enables it later, not built).

> **Risk honesty:** S1.1 is the highest-risk commit in the program — it re-expresses the scheduling engine's entire decision logic and must be byte-identical. The mechanism-by-mechanism sequence + the move-decision-reuse-arithmetic seam are the two mitigations; the 1043-op lock + per-field equality + determinism-token proof is the gate at every step.

*Sign off D-S1-1…7 (1–5 locked; **6 and 7 are live** — the objective-shape change and the reselection-order are the two open design calls) and the four-sub-phase order, then I write the S1.1 build brief (the mechanism-by-mechanism extraction) first — S1.2/1.3/1.4 get their own briefs as we reach them.*
